Test Scenarios_credit processing application Testing

Below are few scenarios for which I created Testcases in my past experience with Banking client on Credit Processing System.

I was involved in UAT:

TestScenario: 
1) Validating credit applications reaching from Internet channel are approved when provided with valid details of customer.
2) Validate credit applications with missing mandatory data(like DOB,SSN etc) are moved to Decline Queue with appropriate Rules configured as per config team.
3) Validate new credit applications with Invlaid data(like Low income, SSN with Junk values etc) are moved to Pending Queue.
4) Testcases to valdate all files in Pending Queue has appropriate letters and rules fired.
5) validating College card credit applications with valid Income range are approved.

In the process of this testing, after 6 months AUT(Application Under Test) is migrated from VB6 to .net for this we have testcases to test all the existing functionality has no impact on new system.
 This include testcases validating UI functionality,field level validation, GUI validation.

I was involved in testing different modules of credit processing system over the period of 3 years.
 During this period I got opportunity to work on Preparing Testplan, Test scenarios and testcases on Excel sheets and upload to Quality Center Using Excel Plugin.
 We had Sharepoint site for storing all our test documents.
 Involved in finding regression Test suite and Executing them for every build.
